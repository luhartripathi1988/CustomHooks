# CustomHooks
Created with CodeSandbox

custom hooks are JavaScript functions that allow you to extract and reuse stateful logic from your components. 
They are a way to share and compose behavior between multiple components without duplicating code. 
Custom hooks follow a specific naming convention: their names typically start with "use" to make it clear that they are hooks.
